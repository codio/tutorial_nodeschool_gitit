#Installation
1. Create an account with http://codio.com (don't be frightened, it's free for all public projects).
1. You're probably looking at this in GitHub already but if not, go to [https://github.com/codio](https://github.com/codio) and search for "Nodeschool", then select the tutorial you want.
2. Copy the SSH or HTTPS url from beneath al the GitHub settings on the right hand side (NOT the main browser page url).
3. Go to [Create Project](https://codio.com/s/docs/console/creating/) in your Codio Dashboard, select the Git tab and paste in the url you just copied.
4. Press Create Project and you'll be in the IDE with your tutorial project ready and waiting.

You'll now need to install the Nodeschool tutorial (each one is an npm package) onto your project's Box. There are two ways to do this ...

- Hands Dirty: open up a Terminal with from the 'Tools->Terminal' menu, then enter `npm install -g git-it@latest`.
- Lazy Way: click on the "Install Git-it" menu item. Once installed, you can close that tab.


#Running this Tutorial
Git-It has a different format to other Nodeschool.io tutorials. You don't write code, you use the terminal.

###Details of the lesson requirements can be accessed in two ways:

- **Tutorial Mode** : select the 'Tools->Guides(Beta)>Play' menu item. Each lesson is presented with a Code window on the left and the instructions on the right, which can be scrolled through and left in place while you code. You can navigate between lessons using the buttons above the instructions.
- **Manual Mode** : open up the lessons folders and you will see a filename similar to the folder name. As this tutorial is all done in the terminal simply click on the blue icon in the gutter to open up the instructions popup.

### Completing the Lessons in the Terminal

You can open a Terminal window by selecting the 'Tools->Terminal' menu item or with the default shortcut Shift+Alt+T. Your terminal defaults to the `~/workspace` folder, which equates to the root of your Codio code project. It is here that you enter your commands

#Verifying your code
Once you think you have completed the challenge, enter `git-it` to view the Lesson menu. Use your arrow keys to select the appropriate lesson and <enter>. 

then enter `git-it verify`. The output will be shown in the console window. If is passes, you will see something like this

#Which lessons have I successfully completed?
As you verify and pass each lesson (or by entering `git-it` in the command line at any time), you will be shown in the console the list of all challenges that are already completed. You will see the following screen in the Terminal window that appears. Completed lessons are clearly marked on the right.
